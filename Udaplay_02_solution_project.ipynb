Here\\\\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the information provided:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Platform Release Information**: The documents state that \\\\\"Mortal Kombat X\\\\\" was released on multiple platforms, including PlayStation 4, but explicitly mention that it was not initially released for PlayStation 5. This directly answers part of the query, confirming that there was no original release for the PS5.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. **Release Date Context**: The documents clarify that \\\\\"Mortal Kombat X\\\\\" was launched in April 2015, which is significant because the PlayStation 5 was released later, in November 2020. This temporal context reinforces the fact that the game could not have been released for the PS5 at the time of its original launch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3. **Backward Compatibility**: The documents also mention that \\\\\"Mortal Kombat X\\\\\" is playable on PS5 through backward compatibility. This is an important detail because it addresses the potential for playing the game on the PS5, even though it was not specifically released for that console.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, the retrieved documents effectively provide a comprehensive answer to the query. They confirm that \\\\\"Mortal Kombat X\\\\\" was not released for PlayStation 5, while also noting that it can still be played on the console via backward compatibility. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on this evaluation, the documents are sufficient to respond to the question. Therefore, the action to take would be to **accept** the documents as useful for answering the query.\\' tool_calls=None token_usage=TokenUsage(prompt_tokens=132, completion_tokens=320, total_tokens=452)\"', tool_call_id='call_9ZLGlHC9QpyNqrqan1U8atz1', name='evaluate_retrieval'),\n",
